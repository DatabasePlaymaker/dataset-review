Aung Kyaw Thu,5,2024-05-16 15:46:42,It is really great app to learn japanese.
Terence O'Sullivan,1,2024-05-16 12:32:23,"Unless you're subscribed (with prices increasing every month, it seems), this app is worthless these days. To compound matters, one of the ads they pushed onto me (due to my being a free user) all but bricked my phone (The ad forced open my browser and kept reopening the ad's website when closed, over and over). Hope this company is making all the money their greed deserves."

Nikki,5,2024-05-01 03:32:42,"Incredible app, nearly everything a long time student and appreciator of Japanese culture needs to keep immersed in the language. Kanji and reading materials, as well as some JLPT (which I am studying for) are centralised into one place. The premium account option is absolutely worth it for the curation of the content alone."

Corben Scotton,5,2024-04-27 13:02:55,"Game changing app for practicing Japanese. Unlimited trap to translate, study guides, flash cards, the text highlights along with the audio to follow along. It's like 3 practice apps in 1. I love it."
Eternal,5,2024-04-24 20:38:21,"Update: Deleted and reinstalled the app, it works now. Original Comment: I really like this app and would love to rate it higher, but the text highlighting is extremely tedious, making it hard to select a part you would like to translate. I tested it in their App for learning German, and it works flawlessly there."
Ty,3,2024-04-20 00:01:05,Good app but highlighting a word to the translation is almost impossible. Instead it will go and highlight almost anything other than the word I am trying to highlight. This makes it very difficult to use.

Brandon B.,5,2024-03-27 13:55:06,Amazing tool for input. I like to listen to an article or two on my breaks at work. Being able to tap on the words as they are read to see meaning and follow along is the best way I have found to gain understanding with context. Being able to save words and make a deck of flashcards is just a bonus.

Damian S,4,2023-11-15 07:39:03,A very useful app for Japanese learners. I only sometimes have a problem selecting text to translate - the caret jumps all around - otherwise everything is good. Recommended!

Lucas Rudd,5,2023-11-13 00:06:47,"Amazing app for learning Japanese through immersion. The articles aren't geared towards complete beginners, so you'll need some knowledge of the Japanese language. There's plenty of articles for people with an intermediate or advanced knowledge of the language, so don't let ""Easy Japanese"" deter you. The app makes it easy to find the definition of a word, so you'll learn as you read. Videos that accompany articles help listening skills. Tip: Read the articles out loud to yourself or others."

Dwain Bryan,3,2023-09-06 00:05:33,"If you're a beginner I would avoid this app. Every article has mistranslations due to the dictionary not providing correct definitions. Also if you close the page to use another online dictionary it will count that as an article read eventhough you're still reading the same article. It's a real shame actually, it could be a lot better."

Farin Soriano,4,2023-07-28 22:14:05,"Excellent resource for studying vocabulary/reading skills using real sources from Japan. However, highlighting words (to define them) can be so frustrating at times as the selected characters often become deselected when I'm trying to adjust the highlighted portion. This is a big problem for me as this is my main way of learning what unknown words in the news sources mean."
Jimmy Hu,5,2023-07-28 10:26:04,Excellent resource to enhance your Japanese learning.
Brian Purdue,5,2023-07-28 06:35:50,Very helpful. Excellent functionality. I am grateful to the creators.
lilo,4,2023-07-27 17:54:37,"The limit of reads a day is outrageous and elitist, if the number was of 50 reads would help a little. And also, getting out of the app, being that to search something on Google or responding to someone on WhatsApp takes one more free read off the charts for no reason at all."
Nozeru Silva,5,2023-07-26 19:22:40,"Perfect in every way possible. It's hard to believe, that there's an app so useful, it has every feature you could wish for, and it's still the free version.

Ricardo W,5,2023-07-22 05:43:40,"Excellent app for learning Japanese while being able to read Japanese articles! The unknown words can be tapped on, and the English translations pop-up. They also have deals, and I had to take advantage of buying the app and getting rid of ads. It's okay with ads, but the low price during deals to upgrade made it a no-brainer to purchase the premium version. (Sometimes, selecting non-underlined words can be an issue, but overall, that app works great!)"

C Q,3,2023-06-18 10:27:11,App wise it is very useful. But I'm not happy with the subscription offers. I was trying the app and want to decide if I want to buy it. At first it was showing me 18 dollars at 50% discount. And next day it jumped to 36 dollars with 89% discount. Feels almost dishonest from the way they are marketing it.
Denis Williams,3,2023-06-17 23:00:47,Very useful for intermediate level reader. Includes ability to customise speed of speaker and the dictionary link is now easy to use. The only disadvantage is the necessary advertising now includes the intrusive repeated Temu ads.

Scott Donnelly,3,2023-06-04 10:39:05,"lots of errors, sample tests at the end of article are also no good. i wish i could sparate article based on difficulty rather than skimming through till i find the right color coded bar appropriate for my learning. sample tests are nice to have"
Tyler,4,2023-06-03 16:33:19,"Great app if you're at an intermediate level to help improve further. Only complaint is that when I clicked the button to show last test result of a JLPT exam and viewed my results, the results were missing."
Nitis Sunghapun,3,2023-05-30 09:25:00,"It's a great app but I thought I can be use for my other devices on my own account ID after I paid for the premium plan. Unfortunately, It can be use only device that you made the payment. Make me a little bit disappointed."

Wendy Cheng,3,2023-05-23 05:57:55,Speaking robot? Not a natural voice as I heard from the NHK website. It seems like an AI voice speaking nonstop without any rythm.
Hnin Wut Yi,5,2023-05-20 09:09:04,This app is so useful.
Vivian Brailey,1,2023-05-20 06:03:36,"Beware, I bought the premium, but after the old phone died, it won't restore the purchase. Forever premium is not true!"
Su Pyae Toe Naing,5,2023-05-19 08:43:28,Thanku
Anachronism G,5,2023-05-17 16:45:42,"As someone who isn't into manga and anime but loves the Japanese language and culture, this is a great way to not only learn the language, but get a peek into what's going on in Japan. There's a daily variety of different topics and difficulty levels, you can choose from. It's up to you (or more like your current skill level) to utilize helpful tools or gnaw your way through it without. You can watch the video versions or listen to the articles being read. It's always fun and informative!"
Saveen Raii,5,2023-05-17 14:12:03,Nice easy to improve our listening

David Jones,5,2023-05-15 09:05:12,"Great app for reading through Japanese news, has a few JLPT tests on for practice, as well as Japanese songs to learn and sing along to the lyrics. I mainly used this for reading and the JLPT tests and it works brilliantly for that. 😊"
Simon Rodriguez,5,2023-05-15 05:54:24,"This is a very useful app, but the font they added in the recent update is awful. Why would you choose such a font for an app that's targeted towards begginers?, It's hard to read. Please choose a different font or give us an option to change it. Edit: I'm blind, sorry."

Dan Bourque,4,2023-05-12 00:09:48,"Overall it's a fairly comprehensive reading and listening tool. A very broad range of content is regularly available and is constantly updating, which makes finding something engaging quite simple. The AI reader, one-touch dictionary lookup, and translations (when available) are generally very helpful. The big problem is that *everything* apart from the source material is user-generated so quality is inconsistent. Even so, it's priced reasonably and great as a free option, no doubt."
Noreen Young,5,2023-05-11 14:22:43,Excellent 👍

Christopher Baker,3,2023-05-06 21:37:38,Used to be a pretty good app but at some point they have started limiting articles you can read per day and shoving ads everywhere.
Kevin Guevara,1,2023-05-06 08:53:00,"I use this app since 2018 and idk why now is literally mandatory pay to have most of the functions, this help me a lot to improve my vocabulary for years but pay for read the news is just unfair."

Darrell Kiely,5,2023-04-05 05:26:54,"This app looks cheap, but it's super useful. Being able to toggle furigana on and off at any moment makes reading Japanese news very approachable! You can tap words to get their definitions, or highlight phrases to see a machine translation. The Japanese text-to-speech is not so good, but it's serviceable. You can still use it to practice listening."

Jimena Blas Gutiérrez,4,2023-03-29 03:57:00,"Hi! I'm learning Japanese and this app has definitely improved my reading/pronunciation skills. It has a lot of features! However I can't seem to make the ""record audio"" button work. I really like the idea of listening to myself while trying to read something but this function in the app doesn't work. It would be great to know some advice to make it work. Thanks 👍"
EDGE 001,1,2023-03-26 03:14:29,Showing premium plan everytime the app launches is just f-ing annoying

Storm Wings,5,2023-03-20 07:28:18,"Not for total beginner, will need some basic japanese around n4 but after that this is a very good supplement tool for reading/listening practice"
Sanshila Shrestha,3,2023-03-16 08:35:46,I love this app but add and upgrade system is more difficulty
Jimmy Chan,5,2023-03-15 12:43:33,Good for learning news in Japanese

Matthew Foster,5,2023-03-14 10:28:07,I haven't found another service that makes learning Japanese via reading articles easier through any other app or website.
Madelyn S,4,2023-03-14 01:04:14,"This is definitely a great app and it has lots of helpful features. I love being able to figure things out on my own and see my comprehension improve. However, the only problem I have so far is that it's very difficult to highlight things that aren't already underlined by the app. Making the font bigger helps, but it would be nice if a few more things were underlined for ease of clicking!"

Anazka,5,2023-03-11 09:37:08,"It works really well and lets you learn Japanese in a more natural way. There are also other versions of this app, with other laungauges, i highly reccomend checking them out! The only thing i find missing in the whole series of apps is the lack of Spanish news."
Miauz Genau,4,2023-03-09 12:36:25,It's a decent app with some glitches.
João Kleber G Lima,4,2023-03-07 21:51:31,"Could be more simply designed, a bit too cramped"

Mark Douglas,4,2023-02-26 07:50:02,"I am very happy with the app because of the ability to use the Audio function from the main menu on a news article. I bought premium version for this feature so I can listen and I can pause and rewind as I follow along. I had to make sure to update the app so this function worked again. Please never change the way the audio playback works. Is there a way you could add in different, more human sounding voices instead of just changing the pitch of the robotic voice? Some of them sound the same."
Belinda Sinclair,3,2023-02-25 23:38:57,"A useful app for learning vocab. However- Please fix the text selection, it is broken and wastes learning time. When you tap and hold text, it often selects a different paragraph to the one you want, it is so annoying and makes the experience less fun. Would love more variety of news and an update to the categories, which don't really match the news provided. I like the option to write a translation and for others to rank your translation."
Danrebu Senpai,5,2023-02-25 14:03:55,The best application to improve your Japanese skills!

ria koike,5,2023-02-20 23:01:59,"I speak Japanese very well, but to get more vocabulary and reading is this a perfect way of learning for me. Study on your own time. Get the news from the country you live, and reading gets better. Also learn new words. Perfect for me. I think for more of you who wants to read Japanese."
Felix Albrecht,5,2023-02-18 23:34:40,"This helps me a lot. I got stuck at some Japanese level where I could talk with my Japanese peers but I didn't advance. Reading Manga is not my thing and the average newspaper is too difficult. This app provides me with what I need, daily news in Japanese to advance my skill with enough support that I don't get overly frustrated when trying to read an article. Also the music videos with subtitles are a nice touch."

Damian Hernandez,5,2023-02-14 14:21:31,"It's a well designed app and i like the multiple ways to look at vocabulary in the context of the article, ability to turn furigana off and on by jlpt level, the ability to change the read speed, etc. It took a little bit of time to get used to the interface, but not unreasonable"
U Ye Gyi,5,2023-02-12 13:12:10,Very useful for japanese language learners.
Henry Chianski,5,2023-02-12 03:37:50,"This app is great for immersion and learning Japanese vocabulary. The range of articles selected daily is extensive, and users are supportive in providing reliable translations. Can't recommend it enough."

Thank you so so much! 🙏🏻 There are so many nice features. I bought the premium version and it's totally worth it. One request would be an option for creating an Anki deck with the vocab you saved. Such a feature would be great to have. Maybe including an example sentence from an article, which the word was saved from."
Aye Maw,5,2023-01-29 04:33:06,This app is very useful for learning Japanese
Leah Reiner,1,2023-01-29 04:22:57,"Reviewing again since i bought the permanent subscription for offline use ($50), and not only did the flashcard audio and definitions not load offline, but cards also displayed photo hints for the wrong words 😞 if card details cant load offline please at least prevent incorrect images, its very confusing while learning. UPDATE: now the wrong kanji is displaying for some words in the vocab list while online."

Adrian Marioghae,4,2023-01-19 07:13:06,Very helpful with a lot of the tools the app provides and always a great selection of news articles to read from linked to the original source. Literally the only reason I'm not putting it at 5 stars is because the highlight feature is very temperamental and rarely ever highlights the words or phrases I want properly to the point where sometimes I have to just give up trying. When that gets fixed I can definitely give it 5 stars as a premium user
Alexandra Polisevschi,5,2023-01-17 09:56:00,"A very useful app if you are learning Japanese and are looking for some reading material. It's helpful that the articles are colored based on difficulty level. Furigana can be displayed (optional), and translation is available for the selected text."
Eric Allerton,4,2023-01-16 19:47:17,"It is a great all in one app for studying. I will read articles a little everyday and add a word or two to my list, but I use the dictionary as a window when using other apps because the writing pad works perfectly with an S Pen to quickly write words and Kanji to add to lists. Better than most dedicated dictionaries. Also, the JPLT tests are fantastic! My only complaint is that I cannot sync notebooks, tests, etc, between my phone and tablet. Even with Premium, which I highly recommend you buy"

Luis,5,2023-01-10 02:47:03,"Perfect app, I bought premium and it was worth it. The only thing I wish could get fixed is when I hold press on some Japanese text sometimes it glitches and it highlights a whole bunch when I was trying to highlight a small segment, the Jlpt tests are amazing too! 9.4/10 app. I recommend download!!"
Rivuza -,5,2023-01-09 21:57:04,Why all JLPT test are gone??? Pls fast fix
D DDdd,5,2023-01-09 13:08:40,It really helps
Ryan Anauo,5,2023-01-09 06:53:47,"I bought premium months ago and have been using the app for months. I got a new phone, and ads are back. I try to restore purchase, but the UI just says something went wrong. I don't really use it enough to pay for it again. Hopefully the ""restore purchase"" feature gets fixed ."

Tom McLaughlin,4,2023-01-05 21:29:15,"They are a fairly good app for practice, they could use a bit more expansion on the words translated and definitions/use. However, in spite of that they are now part of my daily routine, which says something since I hate news."

Rob Smith,1,2022-12-27 22:30:44,"Use to be good, now flooded with adds. I paid for the app thinking it wouldn't have any adds but now they want you to pay for the premium service to remove adds. Total money grab. You'll spend half your time being forced to watch adds. I'd never trust them again. Uninstalled. There's other free apps without the adds."
Luke Schmitt,5,2022-12-27 19:11:56,"Great app to learn to read Japanese, expand vocabulary and learn about current events all in one!"

Franck Caniard,5,2022-12-21 11:30:52,"This a great app to read easy Japanese texts without having to read children books. Selecting text to get the translation can be very painful, but other than that it's perfect."
George Petr Novák,3,2022-12-19 05:41:21,I cannot pay for the full version. I have to switch to my bank app to authorise the payment but when I do that and switch back the play store section of the app crashes.

Hans Wage,5,2022-11-29 01:48:05,This is an amazing companion while learning Japanese. Being able to set the N level you are at so it hides some furigana is a great feature.
"ANTONIO, Jazmine",5,2022-11-27 21:41:05,"I have been using the app for over a month and ih has really helped me to be comfortable in reading hiragana. However, the small texts really bothers me abcs I have very poor eyesight and it is a bother to manually adjust my phone's font size every time I plan on using the app. If there would be a way to have the font size adjusted in/for the app, as an individual, it would bereally helpful.. Thank you :)"

Recoveryanonymous,3,2022-11-21 20:37:58,"I'd like to give this app a 5 star review because it is useful. However for some reason I am unable to sign up for a premium account. Whenever I try to sign up by entering my email and password, the sign up button does nothing when I click it. I don't know if anyone else is having this problem or if it's unique to me. But other than that issue I do enjoy this app"
Reyza Viali S,5,2022-11-20 16:25:52,Cocok buat dokkai dan goi.
Leah L,5,2022-11-20 14:32:27,"I really enjoy how easy it is to practice my language skills with this app. I can click on almost any word to get a description plus the articles get translated so I can easily double check my understanding. It's not at all necessary to purchase a subscription since you get so many free to read articles, but I did anyways to avoid ads and support the platform."
TN Draper,3,2022-11-18 22:56:06,"Updated review for 2022. I got premium for no ads, unlimited reading, and offline reading. It's a very good app for reading and I've learned some words and grammar rules from it! It still has a few issues though that haven't been fixed over the past year: 1. Highlighting words to define/copy them is often impossible and glitches out. 2. Downloading the offline dictionary doesn't seem to help when reading articles offline. 3. Sometimes, words or phrases are underlined incorrectly."
Э. Ундрам,5,2022-11-18 13:59:34,I love this app aaaa

Enearon,5,2022-11-17 21:39:34,"For me is the best to improve your reading and vocabulary but dont use it alone or you will not get any progress. Remember that the way news are wrote are different from the day by day language. Using it in pair with kanji learning books like ""Basic Kanji Book"". I got the pay version and i dont regret did it."
Theo King,3,2022-11-17 20:37:37,"Very very bad podcast experience; as if you tap any area that's not the play control, then the controls are dismissed and you can't get them back!!"
