Original Comment: I really like this app and would love to rate it higher, but the text highlighting is extremely tedious, making it hard to select a part you would like to translate. I tested it in their App for learning German, and it works flawlessly there."
Ty,3,2024-04-20 00:01:05,Good app but highlighting a word to the translation is almost impossible. Instead it will go and highlight almost anything other than the word I am trying to highlight. This makes it very difficult to use.

There's plenty of articles for people with an intermediate or advanced knowledge of the language, so don't let ""Easy Japanese"" deter you. The app makes it easy to find the definition of a word, so you'll learn as you read. Videos that accompany articles help listening skills. Tip: Read the articles out loud to yourself or others."

There's a daily variety of different topics and difficulty levels, you can choose from. It's up to you (or more like your current skill level) to utilize helpful tools or gnaw your way through it without. You can watch the video versions or listen to the articles being read.

A very broad range of content is regularly available and is constantly updating, which makes finding something engaging quite simple. The AI reader, one-touch dictionary lookup, and translations (when available) are generally very helpful. The big problem is that *everything* apart from the source material is user-generated so quality is inconsistent. Even so, it's priced reasonably and great as a free option, no doubt."

I bought premium version for this feature so I can listen and I can pause and rewind as I follow along. I had to make sure to update the app so this function worked again. Please never change the way the audio playback works. Is there a way you could add in different, more human sounding voices instead of just changing the pitch of the robotic voice? Some of them sound the same."

When you tap and hold text, it often selects a different paragraph to the one you want, it is so annoying and makes the experience less fun. Would love more variety of news and an update to the categories, which don't really match the news provided. I like the option to write a translation and for others to rank your translation."

ria koike,5,2023-02-20 23:01:59,"I speak Japanese very well, but to get more vocabulary and reading is this a perfect way of learning for me. Study on your own time. Get the news from the country you live, and reading gets better. Also learn new words. Perfect for me. I think for more of you who wants to read Japanese."
Felix Albrecht,5,2023-02-18 23:34:40,"This helps me a lot. I got stuck at some Japanese level where I could talk with my Japanese peers but I didn't advance. Reading Manga is not my thing and the average newspaper is too difficult. This app provides me with what I need, daily news in Japanese to advance my skill with enough support that I don't get overly frustrated when trying to read an article. Also the music videos with subtitles are a nice touch."

Adrian Marioghae,4,2023-01-19 07:13:06,Very helpful with a lot of the tools the app provides and always a great selection of news articles to read from linked to the original source. Literally the only reason I'm not putting it at 5 stars is because the highlight feature is very temperamental and rarely ever highlights the words or phrases I want properly to the point where sometimes I have to just give up trying. When that gets fixed I can definitely give it 5 stars as a premium user
Alexandra Polisevschi,5,2023-01-17 09:56:00,"A very useful app if you are learning Japanese and are looking for some reading material. It's helpful that the articles are colored based on difficulty level. Furigana can be displayed (optional), and translation is available for the selected text."
Eric Allerton,4,2023-01-16 19:47:17,"It is a great all in one app for studying. I will read articles a little everyday and add a word or two to my list, but I use the dictionary as a window when using other apps because the writing pad works perfectly with an S Pen to quickly write words and Kanji to add to lists. Better than most dedicated dictionaries. Also, the JPLT tests are fantastic! My only complaint is that I cannot sync notebooks, tests, etc, between my phone and tablet. Even with Premium, which I highly recommend you buy"

It's a very good app for reading and I've learned some words and grammar rules from it! It still has a few issues though that haven't been fixed over the past year: 1. Highlighting words to define/copy them is often impossible and glitches out. 2. Downloading the offline dictionary doesn't seem to help when reading articles offline. 3. Sometimes, words or phrases are underlined incorrectly."
